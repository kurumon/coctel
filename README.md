This is the repository for my personal Neocities website [coctel](https://coctel.neocities.org/)! It's all simple HTML/CSS/JS so just clone the repo to run locally.

## About this branch
This is a template for my website based on the PC98 game Diver's by Mink and the SNES/SFC game Majin Tensei by Atlus.<hr/>
